# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any positivity bias in Amazon Vine reviews.

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

There are over 50 data sets, representing different products available on Amazon. I selected wireless products reviews to complete this analysis.

For this challenge I was asked to provide answers to the following questions:

-How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

-How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

-What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?


# Results

There were 613 Vine reviews, and 64968 non-Vine reviews.

There were 222 Vine 5 stars, and 30543 non-Vine 5 stars reviews.

Additionally, .72 percent of Vine reviews were 5 stars. While 99.2 percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.


# Summary

Additional analysis is needed in order to determine if any bias exists. The difference in the number of Vine review vs. non-Vine reviews makes it unreasonable to compare the two.
